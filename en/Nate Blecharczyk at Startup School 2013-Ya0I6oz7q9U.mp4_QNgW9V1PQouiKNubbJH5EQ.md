**Nate Blecharczyk at Startup School 2013-Ya0I6oz7q9U.mp4**  

\[00:00:00\] Wow.

There are a lot of you.

 \[00:00:02\] It\'s awesome to see you know I got some e-mails over the last 24 hours people saying how excited they were to come to this talk.

I want you know I\'m humbled by that.

And also a little intimidated I hope this is get so I wanted to start by showing you how crazy success can be.

Through some charts and numbers and then it maybe painted a little bit more realistic picture.

For what.

For what it takes.

 \[00:00:36\] Where do you get the point this thing.

 \[00:00:44\] You know that went up into the right.

Yes.

Laughter.

 \[00:00:52\] All right.

Here\'s what we all hope right.

You want your company and in the first year you see hockey stick growth.

And for us this is number of guests to book through through Airbnb in be now cumulatively and pay attention to the numbers on the y axis.

As I flipped through this so hopefully you two comes along and you keep growing stale hockey stick growth.

 \[00:01:18\] Then year 3 year for if you\'re really lucky and you\'re five you still have that hockey stick.

 \[00:01:31\] Now what happens when you append five hockey sticks together.

What does that look like.

 \[00:01:38\] That\'s a really big hockey stick.

 \[00:01:41\] And so it took four years to service our first four million guests but in the last nine months alone we\'ve done another five million.

 \[00:01:52\] And Brian was fortunate enough to come to Startup School back in 2010 so three years ago.

Fun fact you know back then it seemed like we were a pretty big deal.

But since then we\'ve grown 73 acts.

That\'s just like mind bending right.

Like.

You just lose track of what that means.

And on any given night we have 150000 people around the world staying on our accommodations so this makes it look easy right.

It\'s not of course if you are successful it will be the hardest thing you ever do think about it in terms of like the Olympics or something.

If you\'re going to go compete in the Olympics for gold what would that take.

What kind of training would you have.

You\'d probably start pretty young and you\'d work up toward that right and you might go to the Olympics multiple times before you actually succeed.

And I really think that\'s similar to the startup journey.

I don\'t want to tell you a little bit about our journey.

 \[00:02:59\] So I got started at a pretty young age.

I was twelve when I was 12.

 \[00:03:05\] One day I was home sick from school and I picked up a book on my dad\'s bookshelf.

He was the electrical engineer and computer enthusiast.

So he just happened to have a book.

I picked it up I started reading it.

I got into programming taught myself how to program started publishing my work on the Internet at the age of 14.

Someone saw what I was doing and called me up.

And said hey I saw your work I\'ll pay you a thousand dollars if you write me this program.

So go tell my dad and I said Dad.

Someone on the Internet was paying me a thousand dollars is like son.

 \[00:03:36\] No one\'s going to pay you a thousand dollars on the Internet laughter laughter whatever debt I\'m going to do this for fun anyway as I write this program my 30 days.

 \[00:03:44\] And the guy actually pays me.

And this is the beginning of a business that I run throughout high school I make enough money to pay my tuition or go to college.

But more importantly it built confidence in me and you need that confidence.

I mean this is going to be a long journey.

You\'re not always going to be successful you\'re going to fail more times and you succeed.

And somewhere you need to get that confidence so you persevere.

And for me I was fortunate enough to have that at a very young age.

So I go to school and perhaps surprisingly coming out of school.

I get a corporate job.

And well I found myself not learning very much.

I wasn\'t satisfied by the pace.

And after seven months I quit.

When I got to quit.

And bosses oh you can\'t leave us.

You\'re our most productive engineer.

Which I chuckled to myself because half the time I\'d been trading stocks anyways.

So I took this as a sign like this is a place that I wasn\'t learning.

And on this journey every experience should be additive it should be it should be building up to that moment right when you go to the Olympics.

And I found myself not not not being challenged there and I had to move on.

And so I headed out west and joined Estada and there I learned everything not to do which is actually really valuable.

As soon as I joined the two lead engineers quit.

I should have taken that as a warning sign but nonetheless it was a good experience I helped take a vision distill it to a product spec hire a team builder product in nine months.

I learned a lot of things.

It was challenging.

I worked really hard it didn\'t end the way I had hoped.

But along the way I learned a ton of stuff.

And I think back and there\'s a lot of things that I\'ve done hobbies projects favors stuff like that.

A lot of them I lost interest then maybe they weren\'t successful.

But thinking about it now.

Every one of those experiences helped me to be successful now.

Every one of those experience experiences that prepared me for Air B and B.

And I encourage you to think about your experiences that way.

So when I moved out to the west coast I needed a place to live and so naturally I went to Craigslist and there I met Joe and moved in to Russia.

We were roommates just by chance in Russia.

It is also where we ran the company out for a couple of years and living with Joe and noticed a couple things about him.

First we were both up late into the night working on our projects would work a long day at work and then we stay up even later working on different side projects and even on the weekend.

And it\'s rare that you find people with that kind of work ethic.

That\'s something really special.

The worst thing is to have a partner that doesn\'t work as hard as you.

So I noticed that about Joe.

I also noticed that Joe could do a lot of things I couldn\'t do.

He was a designer and he was making beautiful physical products.

He had just an immense mind for creativity and we started helping each other out.

And like wow we get really complementary skills and so we kind of filed that away.

Meanwhile Joe knew Brian from back at the Rhode Island School of Design.

They had been classmates at graduation.

Joe had told Brian someday I think were going to start a company together.

I\'m not sure if Brian took that seriously at the time.

But fast forward and the three of us decided we should start a company together that with our skill sets we could take on anything and I can\'t stress this enough choosing your partners has got to be maybe the most important decision you\'ll ever make whether you know personally and in love or otherwise in business.

You can change your desire you can pivot your company you can\'t change your partners without starting over.

And so I see so many people rushing into these relationships.

I mean you should really give that a lot of thought this is something that hopefully will last years.

So the question was What are we going to do at this point.

This is like January 2008.

And so Joan Bryan.

Tell me about something that happened a couple months ago in October 2007.

They had decided to quit their jobs to become entrepreneurs also known as unemployed.

And at the same time the rent on the apartment was raised.

I decided to move out and they didn\'t have enough money now to pay rent so they had a math problem.

Well they\'re both designers and they just so happened that there was going to be an international design conference in San Francisco the following weekend and that on their home page for this conference they saw that all the hotels were sold out.

So they thought to themselves why don\'t we rent out that vacant room.

Two designers need a place to stay.

 \[00:08:40\] But that room had no furniture.

So well Joe had some air beds though.

So instead of calling it a bed and breakfast they called it their bed and breakfast right.

 \[00:08:55\] And they put up a simple wordpress blog and emailed a few designers bloggers and wrote about it and within 24 hours three designers wrote to them and said they wanted to stay.

There was a 35 year old woman from Boston a father of four from Utah and a man from India.

Not what they\'re expecting.

Never expecting guys like themselves who wanted to crash and here they had three very different people who wanted to stay but they had a great experience that weekend.

Not only did they have a place to stay and make a thousand dollars but they all went to the conference together and had a great time.

So much so that the women from Boston ended up moving to San Francisco six months later.

And the man from India invited Joe Biden to his wedding a couple years later.

So like real relationships laughter.

Formed laughter out of this just.

This one weekend project.

And when we talked and thought about this Mike that\'s powerful something happened here.

Maybe we can do this for other events other people and so that\'s what we talked about and that\'s what they were sort of pitching me on.

 \[00:10:09\] I was a little hesitant.

So as the engineer amongst us they\'re both designers I was very cautious knowing that yes these projects they can kind of go on and on and on and you know scope creep and you got to be realistic about what you can accomplish.

So we talked it over and they wanted things like verification and reviews and Facebook integration I\'m like whoa whoa whoa.

 \[00:10:33\] And we wanted to do it like a month right.

I\'m like yeah I\'ve given up Baghead and so they finally pitch me on Air Bed and Breakfast like right laughter which is really the same thing laughter minus a couple of those fancy features and after a couple beers I agree to do this.

 \[00:10:49\] Laughter sometimes that\'s how it happens.

 \[00:10:54\] So we\'re off and running again.

We\'re making a pretty simple site right.

We had different events in our database and you could put up airbags or extra rooms in association with those events.

It was really directory service.

There was no payment.

There was no refuse.

It was really just a search engine and classifieds.

So we cranked this out in three weeks and our whole goal was to launch it for South by Southwest because we had heard Twitter launch air the year before and like you know.

So that\'s a sign and we shall launch in 2008 ISI.

So we create this thing out and about say about 12 people put up properties or rooms or say and Brian goes down there and actually stays on an Air B and B and it\'s a great experience.

The host picks them up at the airport brings them to the house.

The guy\'s wife makes them both dinner the rooms all set up at the end of the night.

 \[00:11:51\] The host asks Brian do you have the money.

Because this was before we handled the transaction.

Oh man I forgot to go to the ATM.

Now is it.

No problem just bring it tomorrow.

The next night they\'re in the kitchen again and hostess.

O\'BRIEN Were you able to get that money.

Brian had forgotten again laughter and suddenly things got weird because this guy started thinking to himself who is Brian.

This guy just met on the Internet.

He was not fulfilling his end of the bargain and paying for my hospitality and hospitality basically wore off at that point.

And so reflecting on this unnice experience we fatuousness on man.

 \[00:12:35\] Wouldn\'t it be good if we could just handle the money upfront so that upon arrival the focus should be on hospitality.

Right.

So this is why we later started handling the payments.

It wasn\'t because we wanted a business model or something.

It was all in the interest of the experience.

People also afterwards were asking us like I\'m going to London not for an event but I still want to use your service.

I\'m like oh no.

You asked me for an event.

Whatever right.

Wait a minute does it.

And so we came up with a new vision which was why don\'t we make it just as easy to book someone\'s home as a hotel.

And we had this motto three clicks to book it.

So basically you\'d just go to the home page like any travel site type in where you want to go.

 \[00:13:25\] Look there\'s some search results.

 \[00:13:30\] And then click into a profile and feel like it hit it.

So three clicks to bookit so down at South by Brian met Michael Cybele Michael at the time was CEO of Jesson TV later than Socialcam later to be acquired last year.

And Bryan pitched Michael on what we were doing.

 \[00:13:55\] And of course he was pitching it right.

And Michael is like wow that sounds really cool you know I know these guys these angel investors who like over dinner could write you like a 50 K check like I\'ll make those introductions and we\'re like super excited by this because we don\'t know any investors how we\'re going to get money and so the next day or next week you know Michael gets the time to actually look at the Web site and he realizes that like we had actually really been pitching him like heavy and maybe we weren\'t as far along as we had made it out to be and so he says you know I\'ll make those introductions.

But before I do that he really is a few things you need to do.

There\'s a few things you do to build up progress you need to show before this is going to be realistic.

 \[00:14:36\] And so every week Joe and Brian would head down to the offices adjusting that TV meet with Michael.

Give me a progress update.

Try to keep him excited about what we\'re doing.

And.

You know things got tough around this point.

So I at this point decided to move back to Boston.

 \[00:14:57\] So I had been doing long distance for my girlfriend for three years and I did really figure things out that I want to get married or not.

So you know I had some other priorities in my life that had suddenly come up and I was in Boston and suddenly the pace really slowed down.

Right.

And meanwhile we get these things that we\'re supposed to build from Michael and Michael\'s wondering as they come in every week.

Man.

Why is it taking you so long to build these features like your co-founder.

He must not be a good engineer.

And meanwhile I\'m like Guys have you like been straight with Michael and told him that like you know I\'m doing some other things and I set his expectations.

But of course they hadn\'t right.

Because.

They they wanted to make sure you didn\'t lose interest right.

I mean we were desperate.

We needed to raise money.

And I tell you this story because like this is this is real life like this is how it is and sometimes your partnership isn\'t always high fives.

Right.

There\'s a lot of stress when you\'re starting a company and no one\'s getting paid.

And you got to work through those moments.

 \[00:15:56\] So eventually we get it done.

And Michael makes those introductions.

Those angel investors and so we are having these meetings and I\'m still in Boston.

So Joan Briner go into the meetings and you know I would always ask how the meeting go.

And I\'m like oh yeah they found it really interesting.

They\'re going to get back to us soon.

I like really vague statements like oh that\'s good I guess so.

Only later I kind of get the full story about what was going on.

So was one time they go down to university cafe meet with this well-known angel investor and the guy has a smoothie and they\'re pitching him the agents drink a smoothie and said listening.

 \[00:16:42\] Halfway through it.

He just gets up and leaves.

Then you finish a smoothie laughter laughter and Gerald Reiner like did you have to use the restroom maybe put some money on the meter.

They like sit around for half an hour never comes back.

 \[00:16:54\] Laughter.

Like what is.

This how it is.

 \[00:16:59\] I mean but you know I guess I guess we didn\'t have much to show at that point we were we weren\'t ready for it I guess this other time happened to coincide with one of my trips out and I\'m like oh great I get to go to one of these pitches finally.

And so the night before looking at the slide deck kind of revealing who\'s going to do what and we come to this slide right.

And it\'s like how much money are we going to make.

Three years from now like in 2011 or something like 200 million dollars three years from now I\'m like guess like if you do that math that\'s how you break it out here that\'s like 30000 transactions per day like that.

It\'s not realistic.

They\'re going to like me just gonna go off on that.

So I\'m like how about like 20 million that\'s more realistic.

OK.

Sure.

 \[00:17:48\] You want the scariest guy.

 \[00:17:50\] So the next day we drive down to Sentelle would pitch pitching theV.C.

and come to the slide and changed it to this exactly.

 \[00:18:01\] Laughter.

 \[00:18:03\] Well I don\'t think it actually matter too much and I think the investor is interested in this from the start.

But it\'s like guys come on like what is this all about.

Brines like oh you know I was talking to Sam Altman.

He\'s like.

He told me that like investors don\'t want arms they want B\'s baby.

 \[00:18:18\] Laughter laughter and it\'s true.

 \[00:18:27\] Investors want BS.

We hadn\'t connected the dots between the air beds and the billions yet.

So it didn\'t work out.

 \[00:18:37\] So at this point we kind of put the fundraising on hold it\'s clearly not working now.

I think with Bernt dollar leads and well on the horizon is that Democratic National Convention coming up in Denver and reading about this event and it\'s going to be held at the stadium stadium holds like 80000 people.

We look it up there\'s like only 17000 hotel rooms in Denver.

OK.

People are going to need our solution.

We use this as a basically a rallying call to get focused and build that new vision we had three clicks the book yet we haven\'t really made much progress on that.

So he said OK it\'s only three months away.

If we start now and are really focused we can get this out in time and we\'re gonna handle payments and do reviews and all that and so we hustle we launch maybe a couple weeks before the event we get like eight hundred properties on there the first week.

I mean sure enough like the locals are looking to get out of town make some extra money.

And sure enough the news is doing stories like hey a historic event.

All these people want to participate but they can\'t afford to.

There\'s no place to stayetc.

It\'s like whoa.

Like perfect.

So we start writing to like some local blogs saying we actually have a hundred properties that are definitely available.

You should check us out or write something and they do.

And within a day that\'s picked up by the local news and like within a day later like CNN International picks it up in radio and like video interviews with CNN and it\'s oh yeah like this is what watching your company should be like right.

Like a lot of attention.

You know a lot of a lot of clicks to this Web site.

Yeah but a week later there was nothing.

There was back to square one and this is up pogroms classic diagram of the lifecycle of a startup and it\'s so true.

I mean everybody goes through this.

You want your company.

You get like a lot of attention.

You get this big spike.

But it really doesn\'t matter because like a week later you realize that everyone\'s attention has moved on you\'re not really relevant.

Who cares.

And unfortunately that\'s the beginning of something called the Trough of Sorrow.

This is like the worst.

It\'s a really hard period where you work really hard.

And nothing you do matters is very demoralizing.

And so basically between August and the end of the year it was only four months but it seemed like an eternity.

We worked really hard and nothing we did in the matter.

And at the same time the whole financial crisis happens right and the market\'s collapse and Sequoia sends out this presentation saying like no one\'s going to be able to raise money again and you know it\'s time to start saving your moneyetc.

Just like on top of everything like it was already hard enough to get investors to give us money.

And now this.

And it really seemed like the end of the road like we were really asking ourselves when do you know it\'s time to quit.

And I think we\'ve probably all thought about that right.

What we realized was before we can quit we\'ve got to get give it 100 percent.

And Michael Seibel could still be giving us advice along the way.

He saw the state we\'re in.

He\'s like guys you got to get focused.

He had gone through like commentor with Justin that TV is like this will be good for you.

So like the application was like do that night.

So he looks totally scrambled submitted an app and got accepted for an interview.

Did the interview.

I don\'t think PGE liked your idea.

He actually told us later he don\'t like it at all.

I mean it\'s pretty obvious actually from the interview the interview went off the rails within the first minute and he was finally picked up on something else that he gets on.

Now he gets an but we did convince him of one thing which was that we were determined that we had persevered through a lot and that we knew how to create things and he basically said later I thought you guys are cockroaches right.

 \[00:22:42\] And he\'s got this saying you know the hardest thing is you need people who will never give up.

You\'ve got to Saffir there\'s going to be so many setbacks and he\'s looking for cockroaches so we arrive at Y Combinator.

 \[00:23:00\] Super excited and again these are our three month period to get really focused and we get really regimented.

All right.

So I moved back from Boston back to the west coast.

We\'re all living together.

Waking up at 8a.m.

going to bed at midnight we\'re doing everything together where we\'re going to the gym eating I\'m sleeping at the foot of Joe\'s bed on an air bed of course it\'s 100 percent focus.

 \[00:23:27\] We\'re doing a six or seven days a week and meanwhile is this financial crisis PGE tells us.

Like.

No one\'s going to be able to raise money at the end of this thing.

So it\'s up to you to get to profitability.

So we have this goal of Rahmon profitability by by March which is basically for us a thousand dollars a week enough to pay rent and buy ramen and we make this graph and we update it every week and we put it on the mirror in the bathroom.

We put it over the fireplace everywhere.

We saw this graph throughout the day and it made us focus and so there\'s a few pieces of advice that we got at kind of the start of why see that made the world difference.

And one was this thing that publicSen.

Paul Paul is the creator ofG.M.

and he basically said it\'s better to have a few users who love you than a thousand users that like you might really find those few evangelists and build for them.

So we kind of put that in the back of our head meanwhile Pidgey said do things that don\'t scale and like we\'ve been thinking about like how do we make this Web site where people can completely do it themselves fully automated like hands off like that\'s what the Web is all about right.

And he\'s like no it\'s ok.

 \[00:24:46\] I do things that don\'t scale and he says so where users are users are everywhere.

It\'s like well where most of your users say OK.

New York.

So he\'s like go to New York meet your users and we\'re like I always supposed to be here at what I do and like you know in Mountain View and stuff.

You don\'t know.

Just go there and meet them all.

So that\'s what we do.

We go to New York we meet every single user all 40 of them.

 \[00:25:15\] Laughter.

 \[00:25:18\] It\'s a start.

You got to start somewhere.

It\'s a magic number.

And so.

You know beforehand recalling that these users were saying oh we can send a professional photographer over to your place and get some pictures taken would you like that.

Like oh yes sure.

 \[00:25:33\] So then Joan Brannen show up right there the professional flaggers like co-founder is the company hired to take pictures.

Laughter a little weird but yeah they\'re already there.

They opened the door.

Take the pictures.

And while they\'re there they sat at the computer gave them a little less and got some feedback.

 \[00:25:52\] We would invite them out to the bar later on to get some beer built a report told them our story really tried to get them to root for us.

And so we\'d go back home and would then call them up and we\'d say Hey look at your profile and you know we only have a paragraph on there.

You\'ve got a really nice place.

Do you mind if we like help describe it a little better.

Fill it out.

Change your title by the way.

Price seems a little high.

Can we just maybe started seventy five dollars a night.

You know if you get Tumaini increasing always raise it.

So we could have never asked this of people if they never met us.

Right but because they were rooting for us it made all the difference.

And so by the end of this exercise we had 20 or 40 really good looking properties in New York that we had basically fully curated when we did that.

That\'s when they started getting booked.

That\'s when we started getting traction.

 \[00:26:52\] So around this time it\'s towards the end of Lycee and there\'s a speaker that comes every week during dinner and so that week Greg Mackie two from Sequoia Capital is coming and we had Greg speak at Startup School actually earlier that year and Greg was talking about like great surfers and like big waves like real figuratively and talking about how they invested in companies like Intel and Cisco and Halik.

These were the kind of companies that Sequoia is in the business of finding.

And so like you know of course it was like well that\'s not us right like we\'re not Siska but here he was at dinner and so of course we had to pitch him right.

That\'s what you do.

So after dinner it was shown our stuff walk them through it and then he\'s like.

Let me see if I got this straight.

And he basically read pitches it back to us and he does like a way better job and we\'re like yeah like like what you said.

 \[00:27:52\] Laughter.

We couldn\'t believe it.

This guy gets it.

He gets even better than we do laughter.

 \[00:28:01\] And so within two weeks we had a term sheet that we had signed and we raised 600000 in seed from them.

And I mean from there it\'s been up until the right.

And you know all of this had to happen before that happened.

Right.

And you know it kind of reflecting back on one hand it looks like so much happened so quickly.

Right.

Like how could you ask for more and I know how could you.

But it looks really easy and it did happen relatively quickly.

At the same time that journey was a really tough one.

And what I want you to take away is that this is a long journey and perseverance is what matters the most.

And you might fail this time.

But if you think of every single experience as a building block to that final competition if you make sure you pace yourself so that you don\'t quit too early and you have to basically bail.

You can do amazing things.

And so I hope that today you were not only inspired but you got some practical tips and I expect to see a lot of great things from you.

Thank you.

Applause.
