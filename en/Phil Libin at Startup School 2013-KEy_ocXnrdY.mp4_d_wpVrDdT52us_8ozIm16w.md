**Phil Libin at Startup School 2013-KEy\_ocXnrdY.mp4**  

\[00:00:00\] Good morning.

I think this is literally the largest number of people have ever spoken to.

 \[00:00:07\] Pretty sure it is.

 \[00:00:18\] Very cool very impressive.

Thank you for coming.

I\'m super psyched to talk to you.

You know Paul asked me to come in and talk a little bit about what we went through at Evernote especially in the early years and the mistakes we made and the lessons we learned.

And I\'m happy to do that.

You know Evernote didn\'t come out of nothing.

It was our third startup and we learned a lot kind of all the way through the process.

The first real startup that I was involved with I started with with a few college roommates of mine you know my best friends in Boston who called to engine five.

And  \[00:01:05\] that was I think the first and probably the most important lesson to me right there was was that I had great cofounders.

The most important thing and this is very much the same team of people that was with me at the first startup and then the second startup and then many of them are even at Evernote.

 \[00:01:24\] And so I think the most important thing to do and as young an age as possible is to just cultivate this group of really really really and high energy willing to work for free.

 \[00:01:37\] Best friends for life.

 \[00:01:40\] And it\'s super important to do that.

And you have to pay attention like I got lucky I got lucky that that the people that I that I happened to meet in college in the computer science department a boss university or people that have stuck with me for four.

 \[00:01:54\] So far the rest of our lives.

And I fully expect much longer.

 \[00:01:59\] In fact I would go so far as to say that you shouldn\'t even make friends with people that you don\'t see starting your company with.

 \[00:02:07\] Laughter.

It  \[00:02:10\] kind of sounds Dikkers shale gas but thank you.

To be honest with you.

Like why.

Why bother.

You only have nearly so many best friends that you\'re going to have and if you can\'t if you can\'t imagine counting on them in a Pinterest co-founder you know use those.

 \[00:02:25\] Yeah use those resources wisely.

 \[00:02:28\] And so I just looked into it I happened to get these great people and and I\'ve been able to get really great people in in every other company.

So basically we started our first company engine 5 the core group of those people went on to found the second company core street the core group of those people went on to found Evernote Evernote.

I really hope is is my life\'s work.

I don\'t intend to really work on anything else but if I ever do I already know the 50 or so people that Evernote that you know that are going to hopefully be with me for whatever the next thing is and so developing this crew.

Is super huge and.

Can kind of tell from most of you.

 \[00:03:07\] You look like you\'re right at about that age and in an area of life where you\'re making these connections you\'re making these friendships and it\'s going to go by really fast.

 \[00:03:14\] So make the most of it.

 \[00:03:16\] So engine 5 was a consultant.

We started this company that was original going to be five of us but then two people chickened out but we really had the domain name and it was just all three of us were computer programmers were all developers and we literally didn\'t know that there was such a thing as investors.

 \[00:03:34\] But this was a new concept to us.

We didn\'t know that there were people who would give you money so that you could build something.

 \[00:03:39\] We just assumed that the way you build a business is you know you start working and you get paid and you make more money that you spend and so on.

And luckily this was right at the lead up to the original dotcom bubble in the very late 90s and so if you could program people would just throw money at you.

And we didn\'t have much motivation in starting this company other than we just wanted to work together.

We want to see what it would be like to have a company to be our own boss to you know to call the rules.

And so we did a lot of you know programming consulting mostly on e-commerce stuff and what we learned and this is probably the second most important lesson is.

 \[00:04:14\] You know being your own boss and having your own company and making the rules kind of sucks.

 \[00:04:22\] If what you\'re doing ultimately is you know being a consultant it\'s just like you just getting paid by somebody else to write some code because you\'re not actually building any value any long term value.

You can you can be getting paid you could be making a decent amount of money while you\'re working.

But all of this idea that you\'re actually calling the shots and you\'re in control is because a complete illusion.

If what you\'re really doing is working for building something for some other company.

So it\'s amazingly hard work.

And the rewards are very immediate but they\'re not they\'re not lasting.

You don\'t you don\'t build anything up.

 \[00:04:57\] And so after working harder than we\'ve ever worked for for about two and a half years you know 16 hour days on average.

I remember I would come into the office at like 2a.m.

and there would be people you know leaning out of the windows smoking because you don\'t have time to even go outside and back then people used to smoke.

 \[00:05:17\] Ask your parents.

 \[00:05:21\] And we finally did so that we sold a company to a big company called vignette in Austin Texas about two and a half years later and we were super happy to sell it because we didn\'t we didn\'t love this work.

We\'re just working for somebody else.

We\'re building stores and e-commerce things and so we sold it and it was pretty cool but we didn\'t know how to sell a company that became to Austin and it was totally the acquirers did everything that you would expect.

Like we thought we would like slid the paper across the table with like I\'m going to write down a figure and split it across the table in totally two years was exactly like that if any of you have seen.

 \[00:05:50\] He always sunny in philadelphia episode it was it was just that.

 \[00:05:58\] So we sold that company a couple of years later we be left wing and we decided OK what did we learn.

You know it\'s time to do something new.

Time to start a company because obviously were going to go and get real jobs at this point but what lesson to be learned.

We said well our lesson is we don\'t want to be consultants we don\'t just want to develop stuff for somebody else want to build a product.

And so we started our second company which is a mighty spinoff of the title cause Street where we got together with this brilliant mighty cryptographer to build a cryptography and security stuff for banks and for governments you know products.

And that was better in the sense that we were building a product we were building something reusable we were building something that we can add value to.

But what we got wrong was it turned out that it wasn\'t a product that any of us were madly in love with because turns out nobody is madly in love with government security and cryptography stuff.

 \[00:06:53\] People don\'t wake up in the morning like Oh yeah I\'m so excited the new government standard for contactless smart cards is out today.

 \[00:07:02\] Well like one guy does that.

I was like I was me.

So it\'s like doubly sad.

Laughter.

 \[00:07:09\] And at some point basically we decided after about seven years of this and you know we had a good experience.

We set out to change the world a little bit to redefine security I think we did that in a small way.

 \[00:07:22\] But what we started realizing was I mean we just like I\'d sooner chew my own arm off than like sit through one more.

You know the Department of Defense procurement process hearing.

 \[00:07:35\] And so we we exited that company.

We brought on adult leadership and we were able to sell that that second company as well and then got together in 2007 and said okay now we\'re all in our in our mid 30s and we\'ve had two companies and we\'ve had some exits.

We\'ve made a little bit of money.

What do we want to do now.

What lesson to be learned.

When we said Okay well the first lesson we were right.

You know let\'s not be consultants that\'s build a product.

But the second lesson is Shinji\'s be any product.

It shouldn\'t be a product about we shouldn\'t sit around thinking you know what does the market want.

Know what does the market fit.

How do we build something that we can sell.

What will people buy.

We got really tired of that.

I got tired of board members and investors constantly telling me which would happen all the time.

They would constantly tell me you know remember Phil you\'re not the target audience.

Know your customers are the target audience and you know remember the best product doesn\'t always win.

 \[00:08:29\] But all those things are all those things are true and especially true if you\'re building stuff or you know systems for banks and for governments but they were just boring.

And we said okay the third time around let\'s do this again but let\'s only build something for us.

Let\'s build something that we love.

Let\'s build something we love so that we are the target audience.

 \[00:08:50\] And let\'s do it in a way that we\'re not going to try to sell a company because we\'ve sold too.

And you know selling a company is his.

It\'s a mixed feeling.

I mean it\'s nice especially the first time you do it if you have a decent exit and you make some money.

But you are you know you\'ve put your entire life into this for years and then you know and then it\'s not yours anymore.

So it\'s at best a bittersweet feeling.

And we said the third time around let\'s do it differently let\'s let\'s have two guiding principles.

It\'s only build things for us that we\'re in love with that we want to use and let\'s build a company that we want to keep Let\'s explicitly say there is no exit strategy.

 \[00:09:26\] Let\'s make something that is sufficiently epic to be our life\'s work.

 \[00:09:32\] And if you have something that\'s your life\'s work you don\'t need an exit strategy.

There is no exit strategy for your life\'s work.

You should have a liquidity strategy especially if you\'re going to raise money you shouldn\'t.

You don\'t need an exit strategy.

Let\'s make something sufficiently epic let\'s make something that we can devote our lives to that we can devote our lives to building to building for us.

And that was that was the motivation for Evernote.

So we we sat around thinking OK well what should we build.

Well let\'s start with stuff that we like.

You know what are we like.

And we said I said you know I play a lot of video games so I love videogames.

Let\'s you know maybe we should start videogame company and we thought okay.

But we already have really great experiences with video games.

You know even back then there was already like a giant stack of games that I wanted to play that I couldn\'t play through.

I thought the world isn\'t like the world isn\'t going to be significantly better if we had another one because there\'s already people doing a great job keeping us entertained with video games.

So then we thought okay well what else do we like them.

And one of my co-founder said Well you know I kind of like the new social networking social media stuff.

And we forget that it\'s kind of cool.

You know Twitter was just kind of getting started.

There was a few other things but we thought you know what there\'s already so many companies doing it and it\'s already a great experience and you know I mean MySpace has already done everything you\'d ever do with a social network like why why would we want to start something you know to compete with MySpace or really providing great great service or could be nothing better.

 \[00:10:56\] So we have we decided not to do that.

 \[00:11:01\] By the way a sock is an angel investor just goes.

 \[00:11:05\] Now but then we thought OK well we have pretty good experiences with entertainment.

 \[00:11:13\] We have pretty good experiences with communication and social networking but when we were using productivity stuff when we\'re using stuff to try to make us smarter try to actually accomplish something.

It\'s for the most part just a really crappy experience.

 \[00:11:26\] Every time we use productivity software it feels either old or kind of cultish.

It doesn\'t really get the job done as it feel very elegant and we thought OK that\'s cool that we were all nerds.

We all want to build a second brain.

We all want to be smarter.

It isn\'t a good experience right now.

It really feels like things like smart phones and app stores are about to take off and get started.

Let\'s let\'s build something that is that it\'s going to be the modern definition of what it means to be effective and productive as a knowledge worker.

 \[00:11:56\] And we set out to do that.

 \[00:11:58\] So we made a plan.

We were going to call the company ribbon like Utai ribbon round your finger to remember and then in in my due diligence in my research about it we were in Boston we were going into this other group of people here in actually very close to here in Cupertino in Sunnyvale that was called Evernote that was started by this guy named Stefan Pacheco.

And he had a team of people upon it sort of this this genius kind of mad scientist inventor entrepreneur kind of Russian American guy.

He had a team of people that actually worked with the went all the way back to the Apple Newton days.

The Apple Newton was kind of the way ahead of its time.

You know first a portable device with handwriting recognition and everything.

And they were working on this idea of a second memory to everyone you know building a second brain.

We were seeing the same things.

 \[00:12:44\] So Snap-On they got together and we decided hey instead of you know of competing let\'s let\'s actually just merge the companies let\'s merge the teams and make something Evernote and so we merge the two teams in in 07 and we kind of recreate it the company relaunched it as a new company called Evernote.

 \[00:13:01\] We recapitalized it which means it\'s a technical financial term it means that it used up capital and Evernote and we made it lower case and we also changed the investment structure that was less important to me.

And we launched the new product in 2008 and it was an important lesson there too which is this was a mistake that I think we made was a very unconventional start that this wasn\'t the typical start Silicon Valley startup start where you know you go to Y Combinator and you have you know a couple of cofounders and you get them a round and you start something we didn\'t do that it was a weird complicated structure with two teams coming together and one of the already had some investments and it will have to get redone.

And this was a big mistake.

I mean it was great that week combined the teams that we merged and the personalities were great.

We were able to build something really fantastic but we were way too clever with the structure and I\'ll never repeat that mistake it does not pay to be clever to be innovative on.

I\'m kind of the structure on the legal entity and how you divvy up your stock and any of that kind of stuff because it basically made us on fundable for a couple of years because until we were significant enough that it was actually worth a BCR time actually understanding WHY we were different and figuring out how to unwind it and how to fix it until we were significant enough to get over that barrier like no one would even even take a look at us.

And it took us you know the fact that we were clever in the end in the early days and tried to kind of preserve this this incremental structure probably cost us 18 months of not being able to raise money.

So I definitely don\'t advise that I don\'t advise doing anything particularly clever or different about how you how you do the basics and the dynamics.

So just pay attention to what people here will tell you and it might see in other resources and just do exactly that be innovative about one thing only which is your idea.

Like that\'s the only thing you can afford a startup founders to really be innovative about as the main thing that you\'re doing everything else you want to do as by the book as possible at least in the early days to to minimize your chances of failing for a stupid reason.

And we almost almost fail for the stupid reason that we were too clever with our legal forms early on so we cleaned up everything.

And you know have self funded and I put some money in the pot of money and we had some friends and family investors but we were just about ready to raise a big round.

And it took a long time but we finally got a 10 million dollar term sheet.

Not from a Silicon Valley investor from a European investor.

The Silicon Valley guys still excited and want to talk to us and we had about three weeks of cash in the bank left it was a very long due diligence because we had to fix all the structure stuff but the deal was supposed to close.

Finally it was so close in 2008 in the fall and the day it was the closing date was actually the day that Lehman Brothers collapsed.

And the investor called me on the day of closing and said Hey we just lost 60 percent of our fund value in one day we\'re not going to do the investment.

And I had we had three weeks of cash left.

At that point we hadn\'t we hadn\'t been able to talk to too many other investors about the previous three months because we were kind of locked up and due diligence you know with exclusivity and you know so we panicked at that point already had 20 something people in the company.

So we spent a week just frantically calling everyone calling everyone I knew everyone I didn\'t know just trying to get you know trying to get meeting trying to get investment.

Nothing absolutely nothing.

It was arguably the worst time to be doing it in the history of the universe.

It was you know like late October 2008.

I wasn\'t particularly good at it.

We had a spectacularly bad ABC pinch ABC pitchman something like this with the quick version that would say Hi I\'m Phillipine you\'ve never heard of me.

We\'re going to do this.

We\'re gonna make this thing called Evernote.

It\'s gonna let you you know write step down remember things using computers.

And we\'re gonna give it away for free.

Please give me Tomingley dot.

 \[00:17:13\] Laughter and applause.

 \[00:17:23\] It worked in Europe.

It did.

It worked in Europe.

Laughter.

 \[00:17:30\] And then usually you know usually they\'ll would be enough to get us thrown out in Silicon Valley.

But but but sometimes just out of politeness they would like ask a follow up question.

And the most common question would be like So who is your competition.

Oh man.

I would I would nail this one.

This would be great.

I would say a competition.

Well pretty much every single computer or phone or a PDA or any other device that\'s ever come out in the last 50 years already has a pretty good free notetaking solution on it.

And that didn\'t help us see it.

Anyway I digress.

So we\'re out of cash.

I spent a week trying to give cash nothing.

Now we have two weeks to cash off in the bank it\'s 3:00a.m.

and I totally remember the day I was sitting there atA.M.

and I decided finally this is it it\'s going to shut down the company tomorrow morning.

Go to sleep.

You\'re going to stand up from my desk and go to sleep.

And it forces us to sleep and come into the office tomorrow to lay everyone off.

Shut the company because we only have two weeks of cash left and you can\'t really take it to zero and you get into legal trouble so you have to make sure you pay the last bills and all that stuff and they decided this was going to happen.

 \[00:18:34\] And I remember sitting there at 3:00a.m.

when I finally decided to do this.

And I kind of had an epiphany.

I kind of thought oh this is what it must feel like to be an adult for the first time in my life I felt like I was an adult this is what it feels like to be an adult to make an adult decision.

Socks whatever happens afterwards and when to optimize my life for being as childish as possible from here on out.

But I decided that this was what was going to happen.

 \[00:19:03\] And at about 3:00a.m.

right before I went to sleep I got I got an e-mail and so I said alright I\'ll read one more e-mail.

And this e-mail was from some random guy in Sweden and he said You\'re Phil I\'m a random guy in Sweden.

And I I\'m just writing to let you know that I love ever no I\'ve been using it for about about two months.

It\'s only been out for about two months that we have been using it for about two months.

And I love it.

It\'s changed my life.

It\'s made me happy to be more organized.

It\'s it\'s really great.

And I remember thinking Oh that\'s nice.

That makes me feel better.

You know they say like if you could make a difference to one random guy in Sweden you\'ve kind of achieved something.

But then then he went on to say in his e-mail.

I\'m just writing to see if you guys need any investment.

 \[00:19:53\] And I wrote back and I wrote Why yes we would like some investment.

And then I stayed up it didn\'t go to sleep.

 \[00:20:03\] And 20 minutes later I was in a skype call with him and we told him the whole situation and two weeks after that he wired us half a million dollars.

And it was exactly enough that half a million dollars was exactly enough that we cut back ice.

I had stopped drawing a salary a while ago and some of the management staff wasn\'t drawing a salary.

Really could really tighten their belt but that half million dollars was enough.

It got us.

It lasted about six months and then the worst of the crisis was over.

But more importantly we had already cleaned up all of our structure in the most important thing is we finally had traction.

We finally had enough data where I could do aB.S.

presentation that wasn\'t awful where I can actually say this is the model.

These are the cohort charts these are the human unit economics.

Here\'s how the business is actually working.

Here\'s how we are making money today and here\'s why it\'s going to scale and that\'s it\'s made all the difference.

And then we were able to to to get financing still not from Silicon Valley people.

Now the first investors were actually Russians and Canadians and Japanese.

We got one of our first investors professional visionaries DoCoMo capital you know the giant telecom in Japan.

The reason we got that was pretty good.

You know they reached out somehow on Twitter because they liked Evernote.

By the way every single investor in Evernote from the early days down to the people that they were bringing in.

Now last year every single investor is a fan of the product.

We don\'t even talk to people anymore who don\'t love Evernote but even early on when no one knew what it was.

The investors were all Giant fans of the product.

So we build it for us.

But it turns out we also build it for our investors and for our employees and for the media and for everyone.

Every other constituency that was important to us.

So DoCoMo came in we were still struggling at that point we still didn\'t have too much personal investment.

But a couple of a couple of executives flew in from Japan.

They had a meeting with myself and our CTO Dave Engberg when my co-founder is in our office in Sunnyvale and you know they came in to the room and would bound and say hello and then in back of me here Dave was talking to them and I hear Dave say thank you very much to them in Korean.

And I hear this and my thought is why is Dave speaking to these people in Korean.

And I kind of look at him and he immediately realized what he had done because he would just in Korea.

And he was just you know his brain just got frazzled so he immediately realized what he had just done that he misspoke.

You know you just said thank you.

He meant to say hello in Japanese but he said thank you in Korean.

And he\'s like he\'s totally pale like he\'s just ashen.

He was so embarrassed.

And then look at the DoCoMo guys and the DoCoMo guys are completely completely embarrassed.

And the thing with Japanese people is they\'re so like for the most part they\'re so emphatic that they have so much empathy like they feel your embarrassment worse than you do.

Laughter and like they\'re mortified about how bad we feel.

 \[00:23:01\] Laughter.

 \[00:23:03\] And so the only way out of the situation was for them to just give us several million dollars Sumathi just to prove that you know there no hard feelings.

 \[00:23:18\] So we felt lucky in that in that as well.

But then you know then things that get a lot better.

And we did have traction and then a lot of Morgentaler came in as the first US Silicon Valley firm and then Sequoia went in big you know several times and it got you know it got a lot harder.

It got a lot harder once we were a real company.

And I didn\'t I didn\'t appreciate that at the time that actually the most fun I ever had the most carefree that I ever was the least stressed that I ever had was back when that low tech and go out of business any day was back when the only priority was to raise money because things were things were really simple things were really simple and there was one fitness function.

You know as an engineer I just appreciated this is the only job is to raise money to make sure that we can meet payroll and have enough you know have enough cash.

And so you know when you\'re successful when the check when you when you call the bank and you see that there\'s a few more million dollars a you\'re.

Yes.

And you\'re totally ready to fail at that point.

You know you just you expect to fail.

You\'re ready to do it.

You\'ve made peace with it.

You know what\'s going to happen.

And in fact it\'s kind of liberating.

And the day after we raise they think our B round which was the first time where we had you know a couple of years of cash in the bank and we really felt like we weren\'t we were Nolt we were out of immediate existential danger.

You know that day we had you know we celebrated we a big party felt great and like the next morning is when it got hard.

The next morning when I said okay.

Now there\'s an actual company and others people depending on us.

Now there\'s millions of users now there\'s expectations.

 \[00:24:52\] Now is when we actually have to now when we actually have to do something.

 \[00:24:58\] And so so you know I can stand here and say traditionally the you know it gets better.

It does very much.

 \[00:25:08\] But it also gets harder it doesn\'t it doesn\'t get easier.

 \[00:25:11\] And so you shouldn\'t be in this business you shouldn\'t be thinking about founding a company.

If what you\'re trying to optimize for is easy it\'s never gotten easier for me it gets harder and harder all the time but it also becomes more and more important and more and more rewarding and in some sense more and more fun.

You know somebody asked me a reporter asked me the other day if if I was still having fun day to day and I had to be honest to say you know what not it\'s not a fun day today.

It\'s a huge amount of fun month to month but it\'s not fun day today.

You know when I look back.

What do we achieve in the past 30 days.

It\'s awesome.

It\'s really fun.

It\'s really gratifying but day in and day out when you\'re like doing the job.

 \[00:25:53\] Difficult is kind of the main thing.

Difficult.

But since I still have this amazing team of people this team with people who are much smarter than I am we\'re much more capable than I am.

 \[00:26:03\] Many of which have been with me now for 20 years.

But you know many have only been there for a couple of months.

 \[00:26:10\] It\'s vastly satisfying and the only reason this works.

The only reason that that I can see myself doing this even though it\'s super difficult and super stressful I can see myself doing this from the rest of my life.

And and it stays rewarding is because we found something sufficiently epic to do.

We didn\'t try to think about what piece of crap can we sell someone to make some money and flip the company.

We thought about what can we do that we will continue to stay in love with.

And this is the main this is the main way that starting a business right now is different from starting a business even five years ago.

You were starting a business even five years ago.

It would have been stupid advice to say build it for yourself if you\'re starting off now.

It\'s stupid advice to do anything else because if you build something for yourself if you build something that you love that you think is sufficiently epic if you make something that you love there\'s probably another billion people in the world that love it as well.

And unless you\'re like a really weird list you\'re just like a starter unless you\'re like a spectacular weirdo.

But even if you are even if you\'re like even if you\'re several standard deviations away from a from the center of the bell curve on weirdness it\'s probably still 10 million people that love something just as weird as you and because the tech world because of the way that the tech world has assembled itself because of app stores and smartphones and social media the tech world is more of a meritocracy than it\'s ever been.

And so if you build something you love those ten million or billion other people will also love it they\'ll know about it the next day they\'ll be able to find that they will be able to use it they\'ll be able to pay you and if you\'re making it for yourself you\'re making something great.

You had a huge advantage over somebody who\'s making something for somebody else because you can at least tell when it\'s great you know you\'re making it for yourself.

You could be an honest critic and an honest judge of your own products and if you\'re not doing that it\'s just it\'s just much harder.

 \[00:28:03\] So make something sufficiently epic make something that you will be able to be a fair judge of when it\'s a cheap greatness or at least when it\'s close to it.

I don\'t think we achieve greatness in Evernote but I think we get closer to it everyday and don\'t bother making friends with people who can\'t start a company with thank you.
