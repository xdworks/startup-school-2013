**Jack Dorsey at Startup School 2013-wEQawgkCMOU.mp4**  

\[00:00:00\] Well this is a huge huge crowd.

 \[00:00:05\] Well thank you all for having me.

Thank you for your time.

I\'m going to do something a little bit different something I\'ve never really done before which was simply read to you from some books that have helped me along the way.

Help me on your transition.

Help me get started.

But also help me through many things and there\'s so many lessons in these books and please if you get a chance buy them yourselves and read through the entire thing.

But I\'m going to give you some highlights and some of my experience with the passages the first book is a book called The Spirit by Robert Henri who was a painter and I know there\'s a lot of affinity for painters in these parts.

This is about creativity through the lens of an art student.

And I\'m going to read it through my phone because I could not find a bookstore that would send me a paperback version of this today.

 \[00:00:58\] So we\'re going to bring up my books.

It starts off art when really understood is a province of every human being.

It is simply a question of doing things anything.

Well it is not in outside extra thing when the artist is alive in any person whatever his kind of work maybe he becomes an inventive searching daring self expressing creature it becomes interesting to other people.

He disturbs upsets enlightens and opens ways for better understanding where those who are not artists are trying to close the book.

He opens it.

 \[00:01:43\] He shows there are still more pages possible and I think that\'s so telling for everything that you all are about to do all the challenges you\'re about to face.

You\'re going to be the ones that open the book.

The world would stagnate without them and the world would be beautiful with him for he is interesting to himself and he is interesting to others.

He does not have to be a painter or a sculptor to be an artist.

He can work in any medium.

 \[00:02:09\] He simply has to find the gain in the work itself not outside of one of the biggest lessons that I\'ve learned throughout my career is how important the work is how important not just the end product is but the actual craft doing the work inventing within the work.

 \[00:02:26\] The work of the art student is no light matter.

Few have the courage and stamina to see it through.

You have to make up your mind to be alone.

In many ways we like sympathy as humans and we like to be in company.

It is easier than going it alone but alone one gets gets acquainted with himself grows up and I\'m not stopping with the crowd.

It cost to do this.

If you succeed somewhere you may have to pay for it as well as enjoy it for the rest of your life.

 \[00:03:00\] And that\'s something if you do something meaningful you are going to have to pay for it in all the work.

But at the same time you will also be able to enjoy it for the rest of your life.

 \[00:03:10\] We are not here to do what has already been done.

 \[00:03:14\] Everyone in this room feels that we are not here to do what has already been done.

No what the old masters did know how they compose their pictures but do not fall into the conventions they established these conventions were right for them and they are wonderful.

They made their language you make yours.

They can help you.

All the past can help you.

I think in Silicon Valley and especially in technology it\'s so easy to fall in the footsteps of others to do what they do because you think it\'s the right because the right way because you think you\'ve they\'ve had the success and you can copy that success you have to find your own path.

You have to find your own footsteps.

An art student must be a master from the beginning that is he must be the master of such as he has by being now master of such as he has.

There is a promise that he will be a master in the future and what I mean what he means by this is purely you have to be a master of your own tools that mastership is not is not a destination.

It is a process and it\'s a constant practice that gets you there.

It is not enough to have thought great things before doing the work.

 \[00:04:33\] We have so many ideas but what really matters is the work to implement those ideas.

 \[00:04:42\] Don\'t worry about the rejections every bit everybody that is good has gone through it.

Don\'t let it matter if your works are not accepted at once the better or more personal you are the less likely they are of acceptance.

Just remember that the object of painting pictures is not simply to get them in exhibition it is all very fine to have your pictures hung but you\'re painting for yourself not for the jury.

 \[00:05:10\] And what\'s meaningful about this passage to me is we work so hard to get some sort of acceptance in the world to get some sort of positive feedback and we look at others and it seems so fast their success it seems like they did it in just a moment.

But it takes years and years and years and patience.

 \[00:05:32\] Bookmarking interfaces not easy Ms there is a time and place for all things.

 \[00:05:39\] The difficulty is to use them only in their proper time and place.

 \[00:05:44\] There is a time and place for all things the difficulty is to use them only in the proper time and place.

With motive you will become clairvoyant of means.

 \[00:05:55\] You will seize and command them without motive.

 \[00:05:59\] You will warble about this in building a team building organization building company is one of the greatest lessons you cannot do anything without a shared and common sense of purpose.

If you don\'t have a motive if you don\'t have purpose that is shared between everyone you will wonder about you will wobble and you will not do anything of infinite means you will not do anything that is timeless mastering the art student of these days is a pioneer just like all of you.

 \[00:06:37\] The union of today must pioneer beyond the mere matters of fact I believe the great artists of the future will use fewer words copy fewer things essays will be shorter in words and longer in meaning.

I love this passage.

I believe the great artists of the future will use fewer words copy fewer things essays will be shorter in words and longer in meaning we must paint only what is important to us must not respond to outside demands.

 \[00:07:11\] You do not know what they want or what we have to give.

I think one of the most important things about what you all of you do is that you are building what you want to see in the world.

You are making that bet that other people want to see the same thing in the world.

Sometimes you lose but sometimes you win.

But the most important thing is you have a passion to build for yourself because that is what infectious and that is what brings other people to your cause and to your team.

 \[00:07:41\] The second book is by a local favorite.

His name is Bill Walsh.

He was the coach of the 49ers attempts to score 49ers.

He took a team that was at the very very bottom and he brought them to the top.

He focused entirely on the details.

He didn\'t come in and just say you only to win games.

He said you need to tuck in your shirt.

You need to clean your lockers.

This is how we answer the phones here.

He set a new standard of performance.

 \[00:08:10\] One of the hardest transitions anyone has to make and especially anyone in this room has to make is going from individual creation to actually leading a team.

It\'s something that I certainly fumbled with along the way.

I was not really excited about reading any leadership books or management books and this was actually the first one that I ever read and it was given to me by Keith rudeboy when I hired him as our GMF square and on twenty third employee and one read a few passages of it from from spoke to.

 \[00:08:42\] So  \[00:08:42\] he starts off the book by saying running a football franchise is not unlike running any other business.

 \[00:08:49\] You start first with a structural format and basic philosophy and then find people who can implement.

You start first with an idea and a philosophy a purpose a mission and then you go and you find people to help you implement it.

 \[00:09:07\] The book if you read it and I definitely encourage you to read this book if you\'re thinking about leading teams or building a company or leading a team within organization is a series of list series a list of what to do.

Here\'s a list of what not to do.

 \[00:09:21\] And he starts off by establishing a standard of performance and Bill\'s standards of performance as us.

 \[00:09:29\] First when you establish a standard performance with your team you start with a comprehensive recognition of reverence for an identification of the specific actions and attitudes relevant to your team\'s performance and production.

Number two you\'d be clear and clear in communicating your expectation of high effort and execution of your skin or performance.

Number 3 let all know that you expect them to possess the highest level of expertise in their area and responsibility.

Number four beyond standards and methodology you teach your beliefs your values and your philosophy.

Number five teach connection and extension.

You don\'t want a group of independent contractors you want people who feel connected they can actually expand the organization.

And number six meet the expectations and metrics of competence.

The demand action and attitudes from personal.

The new reality year of your organization.

Now what\'s important about this is as you start building a team you need to set expectations around how people need to perform in the company.

People need to act in the company.

And these can be very very simple things but without that you are rudderless.

You will react to the outside and if you react to the outside you\'re getting someone else\'s roadmap and you\'re building someone else\'s dream instead of your own.

 \[00:10:53\] And as you grow your collective Bill goes on to write about being a leader 12 habit 12 habits of what to be in a leader.

And Bill has a lot of again what to do what not to do and this is the best example of that number one.

 \[00:11:11\] Be yourself number to be committed to excellence.

Number three be positive.

 \[00:11:20\] Just probably one of the hardest things to do as you start building a technology.

Whereas you start building a company number four be prepared.

Good luck is a product of good planning.

It\'s not so much that people are lucky if they are prepared to recognize Fortunat situations and act on them immediately when they occur.

No5 being detail oriented in Bill\'s way he came into that orientation though lost every single season that had no chance of getting to the Super Bowl and he talked about those small details that no one pays attention to push in our chairs tuck in our shirt.

ACT professional because if you build an organization that does that you\'ve got an organization that cares about itself and cares about doing great and setting its own center of performance and can\'t see raising the bar on that number six be organized.

 \[00:12:14\] Number seven be accountable number eight Bernie nearsighted and far sighted nearsighted is very very easy for us to do.

 \[00:12:26\] Far sighted is not so muchno.9 Be fair number 10.

Before number 11.

Be flexible.

Believe in yourself.

 \[00:12:41\] And an extraNo.13 be a leader.

What that means and what that means is actually getting up there and showing and not telling.

 \[00:12:48\] Then he talks about what not to do.

Exhibit patience paralyzing patience.

Number one.

Number two engage in delegating massive delegating.

Or conversely engage in too little delegating.

 \[00:13:02\] Number three act in a tedious overly cautious manner Number Four become best buddies with certain employees playing favoritism number 5 spend excessive amounts of time socializing with superiors or subordinates Number Six fail to continue hardnosed performance evaluations of long time or tenured staff members the ones most likely to go on cruise control or to relax.

And this I see in so many startups is the folks that start early have the least pressure in the company when they should actually have the most pressure in the company.

 \[00:13:39\] Number fail to actively participate in efforts to appraise and acquire new hires.

Number eight trust others to carry out your fundamental duties fundamental dutiesNo.9 find ways to get out from under the responsibilities of your position to move accountability from you yourself to others and the blame game number 10 promote an organizational environment that is comfortable and lay back in the misbelief that the workplace should be fun light hearted and free from appropriate levels of tension and urgency and you want both.

You want a contrast between fine and also having a good amount of tension.

One of the things that he references is General Patton and general patterns list.

During World War 1 he had 5 6 points which was how Joe ran his army.

No one remember that praise is more valuable than blame number to use every means before and after combat to tell troops what they\'re going to do and what they have done.

This goes back to setting expectations and making sure everything everyone knows what\'s expected of them and what to prepare for.

Number three.

Discipline is based on pride in the profession of arms on meticulous attention to details and on mutual respect and confidence.

 \[00:15:01\] Number four officers must assert themselves by example and by voice number five general officers must be seen in the front line during action again.

Show don\'t tell number six.

There is a tendency for the chain of command to overload junior officers by excessive requirements in the way of training and reports.

 \[00:15:26\] And finally as you continue to build as you succeed there develops what Bill Walsh calls a disease which is a success disease.

 \[00:15:37\] What happens when you really start winning.

What happens to a NAS zation when you start winning when what happens when you start having minor wins that turn into major ones.

He wanted to protect against us as well.

So we created yet another list.

No one formally celebrate and observe the momentous achievement the victory and make sure that everyone feels ownership of it.

 \[00:16:00\] No to allow pats on the back for a limited time number three be apprehensive about applause.

Number four develop a plan for your staff that gets him back into the mode of operation that produce success in the first place.

And number five address specific situations that need shoring up focus on the mistakes that were made and things that were not up to snuff in the six US number six.

Be demanding.

Do not relax number 7.

Don\'t fall prey to overconfidence so that you can feel you can check you can or should make change for the sake of change.

 \[00:16:44\] Number eight.

Use the time immediately following success as an opportunity to make hard decisions.

This one stuck with me the most.

There is never a better time to do the hard things when things are going extremely well and I can be as an individual that can be as a team as well.

never fall prey to the belief that getting to the top makes everything easy.

 \[00:17:09\] It doesn\'t.

It makes it harder.

And number 10 recognize that mastery is a process not a destination.

So that\'s what Bill Walsh had to say.

The book is the score takes care of itself.

 \[00:17:23\] A fantastic fantastic tome of lists and everything that he\'s learned in managing some very very hard and ego driven people football players through a the most losing team in the world to winning four Super Bowls in a row.

Amazing amazing turnaround that he did by building a team and focusing on those details.

 \[00:17:46\] Bill inspired me to create a number of lists of my own and I wanted to share a tool that I use on a daily basis.

It has been most fundamental in my own growth and my own establishment of Praksis so it\'s this participatory I\'d ask you to bring out your phone right now or your computer and bring something out that you\'re going to view on a daily basis.

I made Dark on my iPhone.

I have notes and notes is something that I check every single day.

I have a note for every single person that I encounter in the company of a notebook for every single thing that I\'m that I\'m doing every person that I talk with in the company such as Sarah Frier or CFO at Square has one specific note in my notepad and any time I need to talk to her about something I write it down and then whenever I hear it go through my entire list.

Very very simple memory device but what I want to talk to you about today is a note which I called daily.

So if you create a new note in your notepad or something that you check on a daily basis this is the most important thing.

 \[00:18:55\] Name a daily and then write the word do column and then go down a few lines and write the word don\'t column.

 \[00:19:09\] The one thing I\'d ask you to do walking out of this is to every single day just for a week.

Wake up to this note.

Check it throughout the day.

And then also before you fall asleep check to make sure that you do it and you don\'t do everything.

So what you put in each one of these is you have a list of everything that you want to do every single day.

And you have a list of things that you don\'t want to do and the easiest way to add to the don\'ts is to notice something that you never want to do it again.

You never want to do again and you just add to it very very simple.

I\'m just going to share some of mine.

This might be a little bit personal and embarrassing but here we are no one on my do list is to stay present.

It\'s so easy to get trapped in the past.

It\'s so easy to think about the future.

The most important thing is a stay present and just reading this brings me back to the present brings me back to this moment.

Number two for me is he vulnerable show people my mistakes show people my fears because they can relate because they\'re going through similar things.

Number three drink only lemon water and red wine.

 \[00:20:26\] Laughter.

 \[00:20:31\] Great red wine is a great modifier for it.

I\'m disco\'s with one of my don\'t which is don\'t drink hard liquor or beer on weekdays.

Number three is six sets of 20 squats and pushups throughout the day.

I just have to do them everyday.

Six sets of 30 second planks run for three miles.

 \[00:20:59\] Meditate on this list.

Stand up straight.

Which whenever I say OAC posher moving in the honest say hello to everyone.

I just got a heavy bag some training with a heavy bag so I want to spend ten minutes with a heavy baby everyday I only do a video journal every single day and I want to get seven hours of sleep.

I make don\'t list.

And again this is one of the hardest things in a lot of these are personal so I\'m not going to read all of them.

Well my dentist is don\'t avoid eye contact.

Don\'t be late.

Don\'t set expectations for someone and not meet them.

Don\'t eat sugar.

I\'m on the paleo diet so don\'t eat wheat lentils or dairy and then of course don\'t drink hard liquor or beer although he does.

 \[00:21:53\] So this list well sounds very very simple has been fundamental in establishing patterns for myself.

 \[00:22:00\] And it\'s something that I do check every single morning I check throughout the day and I check right before I go to bed and I make sure that I check everything off and go through it.

I\'ve given it to our companies.

I\'ve given it to a number of students that I\'ve talked to as we\'ve gone to schools and recruiting and people come back to me and say that this is something that works for me.

It\'s something that\'s easy to do and something easy to remember.

What are the most fundamental things about it that I\'ve learned that I\'ve taken away from it is how it gives you focus.

I\'ll give you something that allows you to really ignore everything else that\'s going on.

All the other noise too late to focus on what\'s most important.

So this do and don\'t list for people and individuals that the company has translated to do and don\'t list for our company.

For a square we have to do and list.

We have these are the things that we\'re going to do.

These are the core things.

These are bold bets and these are the things we\'re saying no to 4 right now has been fundamental in allowing us to move fast to kidney Tinnu to innovate and to really push the boundaries and continue that question and reset everything that we think about the organization.

So normally I talk about entrepreneurship and I talk about founding a team and they talk about design and product.

I don\'t do any of that today I just wanted to share some of the books that have kept me going the books that I\'ve learned so much from read so much from.

And I didn\'t want to leave China on a sour note of just giving you a list of 10 or 12 things from a from a football coach I want to share and listen with you.

What we end up doing when everything goes right where do we move from creation.

Individual creation.

And we find something that resonates with other people and we organize a team to build something together.

What\'s the end product.

It\'s something that delight people.

It\'s something that they want to listen to again and it\'s something that they can\'t help but engage in.

They can\'t help but tap their feet to say I\'m going to leave you with one of my favorite songs.

I mean have you heard the song recognize it at all.

 \[00:24:20\] No.

 \[00:24:21\] OK.

This will be excellent.

This is a very very simple but lively song and I find myself listening to it nonstop.

But what it reminds me of is just how simple creation can be but also how complex it can be.

 \[00:24:35\] How how strong you have to be to get to something this deep to get to something this is central to get to something that actually strikes a chord with so many people and potentially strikes a chord with everyone on the planet.

That is why we\'re all here in this room.

We want to build something we want to create something that resonates with every single person on the planet.

Music does that in a very easy way but it\'s very very hard to get to.

 \[00:25:01\] So I like to play for you this play this for you and just listen for a minute.

 \[00:27:41\] So it goes really well with red wine grape and wine so if you take away anything from this day it\'s that you are the future you are the ones that have the ideas in your head you are the only ones that can actually build it for yourself and that is your task.

You are building what you want to see in the world.

You are making a bet with the world that resonates with other people.

Sometimes you\'re going to win the bet sometimes you\'re gonna lose the bet.

You put that lot on the shelf and you bring it back another day.

 \[00:28:19\] But it is up to you to make that interpretation to make that creation and to paint what you want to see in the world.

Thank you very much for your time for your time and great luck in all of your work.

 \[00:28:30\] Thank you.
